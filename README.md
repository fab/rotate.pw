Rotation
========

A novelty demo of image rotation using the CSS -webkit-transform.

Check it out [here](http://rotation.herokuapp.com).

## To Do:
* Allow users to upload an image of their choosing
* Add a slider so that rotation speed can be controlled
* Use a more intelligent method to determine how many photos need to be on the page
