Rotate.pw
===

A novelty demo of image rotation using the CSS -webkit-transform.

Check it out at [rotate.pw](http://rotate.pw) but make sure not to stare for too long.

## To Do:
* Allow users to upload an image of their choosing
* Add a slider so that rotation speed can be controlled
* Use a more intelligent method to determine how many photos need to be on the page
